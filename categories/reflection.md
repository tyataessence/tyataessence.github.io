Welcome to the **Reflection** category! Here you'll find posts about reflections, life experiences, productivity, and thoughts that I want to share with my readers.

This section is meant to simplify ideas and provide insights from daily life, personal projects, and self-improvement.

Below is a list of all posts in the Reflection category:

{% assign reflection_posts = site.categories.Reflection | sort: 'date' | reverse %}

<ul>
  {% for post in reflection_posts %}
    <li><a href="{{ post.url | relative_url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> - {{ post.date | date: "%b %d, %Y" }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
