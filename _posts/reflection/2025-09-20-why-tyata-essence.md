👋 Hi everyone! I’m Rakesh Tyata. I am starting this channel TyataEssence. For years, I hesitated to step in front of the camera and some of you may feel the same. Every day offers a fresh opportunity to learn, to share, and to take charge of your own happiness in this fast-paced life.

Let me introduce myself — I’m a proud Nepali, born in Bhaktapur, Nepal, and I currently live in Seattle, Washington. I have a background in Computer Engineering, and I came to the U.S. in February 2008 to pursue my Master’s degree in Computer Science. I was fortunate to spend 15 years working at Microsoft, and I’m now dedicating my time to exploring new journeys and sharing insights I’ve gathered along the way.

To add, I’m married and blessed with a beautiful 5-year-old daughter, who brings job, laughter and a little chaos into my everyday life — like the festival of colors "Holi, bringing energy, laughter, and a splash of excitement.

**💡 Why TyataEssence?**
The name reflects what I want this channel to be:

- A place to simplify complex ideas across technology, personal growth, and trending topics.
- A space to share practical tutorials and personal reflections you can actually use.
- And a lens to highlight emerging trends in tech and society that shape our future.

**📝 Here’s a quick example of what I mean by “simplifying complex ideas.”**
For example, Think about Artificial Intelligence. It’s a massive topic

- Algorithms, neural networks, and jargon everywhere. At its core, AI is like a human brain trained to spot patterns.
- For instance, recognizing your friend’s voice in a crowded room. This is what we call inference: the AI applying what it has learned to make sense of new information.
- Framed this way, even the most complex ideas start to feel approachable, and even exciting.That’s what I’ll do here: take something complicated, add context, and deliver it in a way that sparks your curiosity and helps you grow.

**🌱 This channel isn’t just about tech; it’s about life.**

- How to use technology wisely, how to stay ahead of change and how to build a mindset that chooses growth and happiness, no matter the challenges.

**🎯 My hope is that TyataEssence becomes more than a channel — it becomes a community.**

- A place where ideas are made simple, where reflections lead to positive action and where you feel encouraged to start your own journey.
